                <h3>About</h3>
                <h5>Data</h5>
                <p>The data that was used for this project was CityGrid, a resource of that keeps
                   track of the general information about businesses. The goal is to request businesses.
                   based of off Zip Code.  Data to be retrieved would be business name, address, website url, and
                   latitude and longitudes to later be placed as markers on a google map.  The rest of this data would be used
                   to create new card objects on the results page.
                </p>
                <h5>Framework</h5>
                <p>I chose to use Material Design Lite as the framework. I felt as if the cards would work well being 
                   generated and it would be in good practice to try something new.
                </p>
       
                <h5>Process</h5>
                <p>This took an embarressingly long time for how little was achieved - around 15 hours.
                   Most of the issues were based around trying to find an api that either give me a key or wouldn't give
                   me any issues in trying to use (which utimately was a failure).
                   
                   <br><br> I started off with building the layout of the pages, trying to leave api implementaion until the end.
                   The most challenging part was requesting data from the api and attempting to work around
                   CORS.</p>
